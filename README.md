## 🎯 Project Overview

WattWise-FL builds a classical ML pipeline to forecast hourly whole-building energy use while preserving privacy. Using the open BDG2 dataset (2016–2017), we predict `meter_reading` for electricity, chilled water, hot water, and steam using Ridge, LightGBM, and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models trained under per-site, centralized, and federated learning regimes.

### Key Features
- ⚡ **Classical ML Focus**: Ridge, LightGBM, EBM (no deep learning)
- 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving**: Federated learning simulation (FedAvg)
- 📊 **Rigorous Evaluation**: Time-series CV with unseen-site testing
- 🔍 **Explainable AI**: EBM shape plots and feature importance
- 🌱 **Sustainability Impact**: Enable peak shaving and emissions reduction

## 🚀 Quick Start (The "Clean" Workflow)

We have organized the project into **3 clear steps** for reproducibility and clarity.

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Pipeline (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Data Cleaning**
Handles raw data ingestion, fixes wide-format issues, and merges metadata.
```bash
python src/step1_data_cleaning.py
```

**Step 2: Feature Engineering**
Generates calendar cycles, weather lags, and building interactions.
```bash
python src/step2_feature_engineering.py
```

**Step 3: Model Training**
Trains LightGBM, EBM, and runs the Federated Learning simulation.
```bash
python src/step3_train_models.py
```

### 3. Launch Dashboard
Visualize the results and explore the data interactively.
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## 🏆 Results

Our models achieved state-of-the-art performance on the test set:

| Model | Accuracy (R2 Score) | Error (RMSLE) | Description |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **LightGBM** | **97.9%** | **0.2695** | High-precision Gradient Boosting |
| **EBM** | **92.9%** | **0.4173** | Fully Explainable Additive Model |

*Note: Federated Learning simulation also completed successfully across 18 clients.*

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Forecasting**: Predict hourly `meter_reading` (kWh) for building energy consumption
2. **Privacy**: Implement federated learning to train models without sharing raw data
3. **Explainability**: Use EBM and interpretable methods for operator trust
4. **Validation**: Rigorous time-series CV + unseen-site testing
5. **Impact**: Enable peak shaving, load shifting, and emissions reduction

## 🧪 Models & Approaches

### Baseline Models
- Naive: Same hour last week
- Rolling mean: 24-hour average
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (with regularization)

### Main Models
- **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting decision trees
- **EBM**: Explainable Boosting Machine (interpretable additive model)

### Training Regimes
1. **Per-Site**: Train separate model for each building
2. **Centralized**: Pool all data, train one global model
3. **Federated**: FedAvg with local training, aggregate model updates

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

- **Primary**: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error)
- **Secondary**: MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Diagnostics**: Error by season, temperature band, meter type, building type
